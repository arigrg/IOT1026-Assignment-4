﻿// This is the Robot class that represents a robot with properties and methods for controlling its behavior.
// It provides functionality for loading commands, running the commands, and maintaining the robot's position and power state.
// The class implements the ICommand interface for command execution.
// Note: The implementation of RobotCommand and ICommand interfaces is not provided in this code snippet.
// Make sure to define them correctly and include their respective code in your implementation.

// Change to 'using Assignment.InterfaceCommand' when you are ready to test your interface implementation
